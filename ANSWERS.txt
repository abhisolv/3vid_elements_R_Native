Q1. What's your favourite state management library for react and why?
Ans - My favourite state management library is Redux, and i like to use it because in redux devtools it is easy to trace when,where,why and how the state of application changed which makes easy for me to trace the bug, but for developing some small apps redux is not preferrable because of its huge size.
but if i am developing a small app or small site i will prefer to use Hookstate because its lightweight .and easy to use

1- Classifying components
	-Presentation components
